# Terragrunt-Basics

# What is terragrunt?
  Terragrunt is a thin wrapper around Terraform that simplifies managing Terraform configurations by addressing several of Terraform's challenges related to code duplication, environment   management, and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles. It helps improve the automation and organization of Terraform workflows, especially in large infrastructures. Here are some key    features of Terragrunt:

# DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): 
  Terragrunt allows you to create reusable infrastructure code by minimizing the need to copy and paste Terraform code across environments and regions. You can   manage common                configuration files (e.g., backends, variables) in a central location and inherit them across multiple modules.

# Remote State Management:
  Terragrunt simplifies remote state configuration, automatically configuring backend settings (like S3 or Consul for storing state) by using centralized configuration files. 
  This reduces the possibility of misconfigurations in your Terraform state management.

 # Environment and Infrastructure Promotion:
   With Terragrunt, you can manage environments like dev, stage, and prod more easily. It provides environment-specific configurations, such as changing variables, backends, and             provider settings without duplicating code.

 # Dependencies Management:
   Terragrunt provides built-in support for managing dependencies between different Terraform modules. This allows you to define the order in which resources are applied and makes it        easier to manage complex infrastructures with multiple interdependent Terraform modules.

 # Automation and Orchestration:
   Terragrunt simplifies orchestrating multiple Terraform modules by adding extra functionality on top of Terraform, such as auto-init, auto-retry, and recursive directory                   processing.
