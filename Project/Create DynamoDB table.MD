Terraform uses DynamoDB as a locking mechanism to ensure that only one process modifies the state at a time.

To create a DynamoDB table for Terraform's remote state locking, you can follow these steps. 

Step 1: Create DynamoDB Table

Navigate to AWS Management Console.

Create a DynamoDB Table with the following attributes:


Table Name: terraformstatebucketca2023

Primary Key:

Partition Key (Hash Key): LockID (String)


Also, make sure you have created the S3 Bucket and named it as terraformstatebucket2024
